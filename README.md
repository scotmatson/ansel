# Geppetto

Geppetto melds together the robustness of the [filepreview](https://github.com/maxlabelle/filepreview) repository with the powerful Chrome headless browser [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer), together these two packages provide a sandboxed utility for visualizing a variety of files when performing malware analysis.
